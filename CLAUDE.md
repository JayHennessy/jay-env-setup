# Project Guidelines

## Mise Tool Management

- **Always verify a tool exists in the mise registry before adding it to `dot_config/mise/config.toml`.**
  Run `mise registry | grep -i <tool>` to confirm availability and get the correct package name.
- If a tool isn't in the registry, inform the user rather than guessing at package names.
